- **Borrow Books**: Borrow a book from the library, ensuring that it is available.
- **Return Books**: Return a borrowed book, updating its availability.
- **View Available Books**: View a list of all available books in the library.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Run the tests using `pytest`.
4. Run the library system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- `pytest` for testing.

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```
pytest
```

## Implementation
The library management system follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring high test coverage and clean, maintainable code.
